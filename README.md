# PADI2

refinement of Assembly from PASS

Continuation of [pAss - Protein Guided Assembly for Metagenomics](https://github.com/etheleon/pAss)

* Extract reads in MaxDiversityRegions of given gene family after first round of gene centric assembly and carrys out second round of MDR centric assembly. 

NOTE: Currently the code is only meant for simulation data, we will soon publish the neccessary code to run on a untested metagenomic sample.

PADI2: Further refinement by applying a dynamic threshold to screen contigs, to select for contigs to act as scaffolds
